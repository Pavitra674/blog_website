# Project Summary: SBlog - A Blogging Website


Welcome to the "blog_website" project, where I'm revolutionizing the way bloggers and readers connect through an immersive online platform. Are you ready to experience a dynamic and interactive space that empowers you to create, publish, and explore captivating blog content? Our project is your gateway to a user-friendly and visually appealing website designed to redefine your blogging experience.

At the heart of the "blog_website" project lies the goal of providing a seamless interface for bloggers to express their ideas and readers to engage with captivating content. With careful attention to user experience, the platform offers a responsive layout, ensuring optimal functionality across various devices. As you navigate through the project's repository, you'll discover a well-structured architecture comprising directories for templates, static assets, and scripts. This modular approach reflects my commitment to maintainability and scalability.

The SBlog project is a responsive blogging website designed using HTML and CSS. The website consists of several pages including the home page, search results page, and contact page. The project's main features are as follows:

1. **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar is consistent across all pages and is located at the top of the screen. It includes the website logo, navigation links (Home, About, Contact), and a search form.

2. **Home Page (index.html)**: The home page features a header section with a title and introductory text about iBlog. The main content is divided into two columns: a content description on the left and an image on the right. Featured articles are displayed below the content columns, showcasing article images, titles, author names, and publication dates.

3. **Search Results Page (search.html)**: The search results page provides search results for articles related to a specific query. It displays a header indicating the search query and search duration. Similar to the home page, it also includes a year filter option and displays a list of articles with their titles, author names, and publication dates.

4. **Contact Page (contact.html)**: The contact page provides a form for users to get in touch with the iBlog team. The form includes fields for name, phone number, email, and  message. A "Submit" button is present at the end of the form for sending messages.

5. **Styling**: The project uses a consistent set of CSS files for styling, including "utils.css" for utility classes, "style.css" for main styling, "mobile.css" for mobile responsiveness, and "contact.css" for styling related to the contact page.

6. **Footer**: A footer is present at the bottom of each page, displaying copyright information and attributing vector credits.

The SBlog project aims to provide an attractive and user-friendly interface for bloggers and readers. It features a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on different devices and screen sizes. The navigation bar's consistency allows users to easily navigate between different sections of the website. The website's styling is clean and modern, making it visually appealing for visitors.

Overall, the SBlog project demonstrates proficiency in frontend development, incorporating responsive design principles, consistent styling, and interactive features for a seamless user experience.
